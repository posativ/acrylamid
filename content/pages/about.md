Some people call me Owen, some call me blubee or even 文文。 You can call me whatever you like, although I don't have to dignify you with my response :)
This is a place that I setup online to house all the things that I'm interested in. I'd like to share a quote with you that I find quite interesting.

With that being said, if you happen to find something on this website that inspires you, i'd love to hear about it. You can head over to my [contact page]
and tell me about it.

I enjoy doing, only through doing can you really find out what's your calling in life. Sure we can spend time contemplating and thinking about things but
doing is where the magic happens. Now sure, you don't have to do things today or even tomorrow or even on this trip around but eventually we all get
to the place where doing gets done. With that, I'll leave you with one more quote.
