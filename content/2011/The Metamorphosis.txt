One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered
that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug. He lay on his
armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched
abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections. From this height the blanket,
just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His
numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference,
flickered helplessly before his eyes.

"What's happened to me," he thought. It was no dream. His room, a proper room
for a human being, only somewhat too small, lay quietly between the four
well-known walls. Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of sample
cloth goods was spread out (Samsa was a traveling salesman) hung the picture
which he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and set in
a pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa.
She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur
muff into which her entire forearm disappeared.
