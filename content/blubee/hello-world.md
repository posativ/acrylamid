#Getting Started

It's been a long time since i've written any blog posts, I've been pre-occupied with life and wanting to simplify things a bit.
I took a bit of time away from software development to focus on getting back into shape. I took a little bit of time getting
into shape.

I initially had the idea to create many different sites about the different parts of my life but after doing that for a while,
I realized that just maintaining so many different sites would become a major pain so I decided to create [blubee.me](http://blubee.me "the place blubee calls home")
It's a place that I can organize all my and share my thoughts from software development all the way down to my Mandarin studies and
whatever else I feel like sharing.

##Simplify and Proceed

I enjoy simplicity over complexity but I also enjoy the freedom to choose. Building this site from the ground up removed a lot of the moving parts of a typical
blog and has put a lot more control over my content back in my hands.

Just wanna say that blubeesback :) woot woot.

I'll be in touch but for now, toodles.
