Templating
==========

The default theme is very minimalistic and may don't fit to everyone's
expectations. But like every blog compiler, you can edit the complete layout to
your likings.

Unlike others Acrylamid knows when you edited a template file, hence when you do
a session on templates and just the your changes without any interaction, launch
Acrylamid in auto-compile mode (``acrylamid autocompile``) and even when you
have hundrets of postings you will see your result almost immediately appear.
